# yet-another-album-cover-finder
This program scans a tree of directories containing mp3 files. For each directory, it attempts to download the cover image from the Apple iTunes service. Subdirectories must be named <Artist>/<Album> and contain .mp3 files to be considered. The cover will be saved to "cover.jpg" in each directory.
